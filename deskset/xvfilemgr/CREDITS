This is a list of all people who helped making xvfilemgr what it is
today.


Thank you

James B. Hiller: He has found the reason for the path panel bug which
causes xvfilemgr to segfault every time one double clicks on an icon
in the path panel.

Vincent Cojot: Vincent has contributed a lot of code for xvfilemgr.
Without this xvfilemgr would still be an very unfinished program.

Christoph Spiel: Christoph has wrote the little start skript which
comes together with xvfilemgr.

Alessandro Russo: Alessandro found a bug in the parsing routine for
filetype files. The command to invoke on double click can contain
spaces now.

Marc Huguet Puig: Marc fixed the code reading /etc/filetype and helped fix
several seg faults. He also contributed new code for removeable devices
and plans on improving many things in xvfilemgr. Marc is at
http://www.fut.es/~mhp/http/mhp.asc

Gabriel Somlo: Gabriel contributed some code that fixed a SIGSEV inside
workwindow.c.
