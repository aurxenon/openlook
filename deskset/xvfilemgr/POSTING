*******************************************************************************

This is the first public release of XVFilemanger (0.2a)

*******************************************************************************

XVFilemanager is a graphical file manager.  Is supports the Openlook
standard defined by Sun Microsystems.  XVFilemanager looks much like
the well-known filemgr on Solaris but is a complete independent
implementation based on the freely available XView toolkit and the
also freely available Slingshot extention.  Currently XVFilemanager
supports Linux but there are only a few system dependent parts so
porting to other xview platforms should be possible.

Besides the normal file operations XVFilemanager provides the following
features:

o Easy usage.  The most common operations could be done with the mouse
  and with drag and drop.

o XVFilemanager provides drag and drop.  Files could be draged not
  only between windows of the same XVFilemanager instance but also
  between different instances and even between XVFilemanager and other
  programs which supports the drag and drop protocol of XVFilemanager
  such as a modified version of "textedit".  Developer who are
  interested in the drag and drop protocol to make their programs
  interoperable with XVFilemanager should send me an email.

o Graphical representation of the directory hierarchy. 

o Full color icons in Xpm format.

o Freely configurable filetypes.  Files are associated with a filetype
  through its extension or its content.  Every filetype has an icon and
  an default action so every type of file could have an own icon and
  standard action which is invoked after double clicking on the icon.

o When using the waste basket previously deleted files could be
  undeleted easily.

o The representation of the files is highly configurable.  These
  settings are kept for the last visited directories.

The installation should be without any problems because there is an
imake file.  If there are problems they are mostly due to an incomplete
or incorrect xview or slingshot installation.
