			XVMoontool 3.1

I ported the original code to XView3.2 / Linux to learn a little bit
about programming especially with the XView toolkit.
The initial point of porting was finding a statical linked Motif binary 
(550K) of xmoontool for Linux on a Slackware distribution. Because I'm 
everytime short in diskspace and I couldn't find Motif on my computer I 
began this little job of porting with some new features. 

New features are : - display moon rise/set time 
		     based on code of Marc T. Kaufman
		     ( see riseset.c )
		   - no colormode option , colormode is the default
		     ( I hope all "linuxers" have a color display )

                             Moontool 3.0

What good is a Sun without a Moon?  This version of Moontool  includes
versions  for SunView (moontool) and for OpenWindows (xmoontool).  The
OpenWindows version should be portable to any platform  that  supports
OLIT   3.0,  but  as  of  this  writing  I've  only  tested  it  on  a
SparcStation.

Moontool was designed and implemented by:

    John Walker

Major enhancements were made by Ron Hitchens:

    ronbo@vixen.uucp
    ...!uunet!cs.utah.edu!caeco!vixen!ronbo
    hitchens@cs.utexas.edu

John Walker created the initial OpenWindows version of Moontool.

This  program is in the public domain: "Do what thou wilt shall be the
whole of the law".  I'd appreciate  receiving  any  bug  fixes  and/or
enhancements,  which  I'll  incorporate  in  future  versions  of  the
program.  Please leave the original attribution information intact  so
that credit and blame may be properly apportioned.

Sources  for  the  algorithms  used  by  the  program are cited in the
comments at the beginning of moontool.c and xmoontool.c.
