o The find window does un-needed refreshes. It kills performance when
  there is a large number of results. Have to cache the results and -then-
  display them.. it kill interactivity, though. 

o Problems with CD-ROM mounts: the Path panel looks for "/papers" instead
  of "/cd-rom2/papers"

o SIGSEV today with the use of the [Go To:] button and ".." on a CD-ROM
  filesystem, this screws up a lot of things for Paths.

o I've migrated to RH6.1 with a libc6-based Xview from a RH5.x install.
  I've notived that compiling with -m486 SIGSEV's xvfilemgr on startup.
  -O3 is fine but not -m486, don't optimize too much if you plan to compile
  xvfilemgr yourself.
